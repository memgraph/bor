Your task is to convert natural language into a knowledge graph, based on data previously stored in the knowledge graph. 

You will be given all previously stored data in the Memgraph graph database, designated by <data>. The data is in the form of a CYPHERL file. Note the entities and relationships which already exist in the graph, and their types.

Next, you will be given a prompt in natural language, designated by <prompt>. 
The prompt comes from a file, given after <file_path>.
The file is stored in a repository, given after <repo_path>.

Identify the entities, relationships and attributes which should be added to the already existing graph. Pay attention to the types of the new entities, relationships and attributes.

Convert the prompt into Cypher CREATE, SET and MERGE queries after <cypher>. Pay special attention to the direction of edges.
Set the attribute 'file_path' of every new node and edge equal to the source of the prompt.
Set the attribute 'repo_path' of every node and edge created equal to the repository where the prompt comes from.
